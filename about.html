    </h1>
    <p>
      An individual built from equal parts creative and technical. In addition
      to completing UCLA's Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp in the Fall of
      '22, Jamie also spent several years at The Second City in Chicago where
      he learned the invaluable skills of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Team Building</li>
      <li>
        Active Listening - being present and reactive to what's around you
      </li>
      <li>
        Cooperative Creation - the core of the "yes, and" philosophy in
        improvisation
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Jamie also has 20 years of experience in Film, TV, and Stage Production,
      combined with 25 years in the Service Industry. Some of the skills
      gained in that time include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Film editing and SFX creation (Adobe, Final Cut)</li>
      <li>Directing (team leading)</li>
      <li>Producing (short films and staged plays)</li>
      <li>
        Empathy and Insight (from both acting and years as a restaurant
        server)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As an individual who thrives on discovery, Jamie has found a seemingly
      endless well in the world of Coding. He hopes that his journey can
      coincide with yours in a relationship that will be mutually beneficial.
